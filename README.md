# LinkedList Template Library

This repository contains a template library that implements three data structures: **LinkedList**, **Stack**, and **Queue**. The primary implementation of these data structures is based on a singly linked list.


## Overview
- **LinkedList**: A basic implementation of a singly linked list that supports operations such as adding, removing, and finding elements.
- **Stack**: Implemented using the LinkedList class, providing LIFO (Last In, First Out) functionality.
- **Queue**: Implemented using the LinkedList class, providing FIFO (First In, First Out) functionality.


## Features

- **LinkedList**:
  - Create an empty list or initialize from a vector.
  - Append and prepend elements.
  - Insert elements after a given node.
  - Remove elements from the head or a specified value.
  - Clear the list.
  - Find elements in the list.
  - Check the size of the list.

- **Stack**:
  - Push elements onto the stack.
  - Pop elements from the stack.
  - Peek at the top element of the stack.

- **Queue**:
  - Enqueue elements to the back of the queue.
  - Dequeue elements from the front of the queue.
  - Peek at the front element of the queue.
